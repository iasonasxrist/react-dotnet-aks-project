# Shared Database Architecture with Range-Based Partitioning in ASP.NET Core (ID-Based)

## Overview

This project demonstrates a shared database architecture with range-based partitioning using ASP.NET Core, PostgreSQL, and a Movies API. In this scenario, the partitioning is based on the `Id` of the `Movie` entity. This might be used to ensure data is distributed evenly across partitions, particularly if the `Id` values are generated in a sequential manner.

## Architecture

### Shared Database

- Multiple "logical tenants" (data segments based on ID ranges) share the same database instance.
- Data segregation is managed via partitioning based on an `Id` range.

### Range-Based Partitioning (PostgreSQL)

- Tables are partitioned based on ranges of `Movie.Id` values (UUID in this case).
- Each partition contains movies whose `Id` falls within a specific range.
- This partitioning aims to optimize query performance and manage large datasets.

### ASP.NET Core API

- Provides RESTful endpoints for managing movies data.
- The API must be aware of the ID ranges for different partitions when inserting or updating data.
- Dynamic connection string generation is _not_ typically required, but the database context needs to properly target the correct partition for operations.
- Data access layer (e.g., Entity Framework Core) interacts with the partitioned tables.

### Microsoft SQL Server Database

- Database server hosting the partitioned movie data.
- Partitions managed using PostgreSQL's built-in partitioning features.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core:** Web framework for building APIs and backend services.
- **C#:** Programming language for .NET development.
- **Entity Framework Core (EF Core):** ORM for database interaction.
- **PostgreSQL:** Relational database management system.
- **Npgsql:** .NET data provider for PostgreSQL.
- **Dependency Injection (DI):** For managing application dependencies.
- **Middleware:** Not used for tenant resolution, but may be used for other context setup.

## Prerequisites

1.  **.NET SDK:** Download and install the .NET SDK ([https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)).
2.  **PostgreSQL:** Install PostgreSQL database server ([https://www.postgresql.org/download/](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)).
3.  **IDE:** Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code with C# extension.

## Setup and Configuration

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [project-directory]
```

## Guide to give permissions to ACRregistry for Images

```az ad sp create-for-rbac \
  --name github-acr-pusher \
  --role acrpush \
  --scopes /subscriptions/subId/resourceGroups/iasonasaz204/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/acr-name \
  --sdk-auth
```

Returns Example
{
"clientId": "",
"clientSecret": "",
"subscriptionId": "",
"tenantId": "",
"activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
"resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "https://management.azure.com/",
"activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "https://graph.windows.net/",
"sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net:8443/",
"galleryEndpointUrl": "https://gallery.azure.com/",
"managementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net/"
